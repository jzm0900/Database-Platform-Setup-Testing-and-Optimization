# Database Platform Setup, Testing, and Optimization Project

## Overview
This project simulates the role of a database administrator at a data analytics consulting company tasked with setting up, testing, and optimizing a data platform. The project encompasses managing on-premises database servers like MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as cloud-based databases like IBM DB2. The main objectives include configuring, tuning, securing, backing up, and monitoring the databases to ensure peak performance.

Additionally, two bash scripts were created as part of the project:
- One script for database setup tasks.
- Another script for database backup procedures.

### Bash Scripts
- [Database Setup Script](https://github.com/jzm0900/Database-Platform-Setup-Testing-and-Optimization/blob/main/db-backup.sh): This script automates the setup tasks for the databases, including configuration and initialization steps.
- [Database Backup Script](link/to/backup_script.sh): Use this script to automate the backup procedures for the databases, ensuring data integrity and availability.
